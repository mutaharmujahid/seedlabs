# ARP Cache Poisoning Lab
- The objective of this lab is to gain the first-hand experience on the ARP cache poisoning
attack, and learn what damages can be caused by such an attack. In particular, We will use the ARP
attack to launch a man-in-the-middle attack, where the attacker can intercept and modify the packets between
the two victims A and B. Another objective of this lab is to practice packet sniffing and spoofing
skills, as these are essential skills in network security, and they are the building blocks for many network
attack and defense tools. We will use Scapy to conduct lab tasks. This lab covers the following topics:<br/>
• The ARP protocol<br/>
• The ARP cache poisoning attack<br/>
• Man-in-the-middle attack

- Detailed report of the lab can be found [here](https://github.com/MohammedMutahar-Mujahid/seedlabs/blob/main/ARP%20Cache%20Poisoning%20Attack/ARP%20Cache%20Poisoning%20Attack%20Lab.pdf).
