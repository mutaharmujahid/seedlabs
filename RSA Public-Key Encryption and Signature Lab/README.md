# RSA Public-Key Encryption & Signature Lab

- The learning objective of this lab is for students to gain hands-on experiences on the RSA algorithm.
From lectures, students should have learned the theoretic part of the RSA algorithm, so they know mathematically how to generate public/private keys and how to perform encryption/decryption and signature
generation/verification. This lab enhances student’s understanding of RSA by requiring them to go through
every essential step of the RSA algorithm on actual numbers, so they can apply the theories learned from
the class. Essentially, students will be implementing the RSA algorithm using the C program language. The
lab covers the following security-related topics:<br/>
• Public-key cryptography<br/>
• The RSA algorithm and key generation<br/>
• Big number calculation<br/>
• Encryption and Decryption using RSA<br/>
• Digital signature<br/>
• X.509 certificate
