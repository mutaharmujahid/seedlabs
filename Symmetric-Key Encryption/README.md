# Secret-Key Encryption Lab
- The learning objective of this lab is to get familiar with the concepts in the secret-key encryption
and some common attacks on encryption. From this lab, we will gain a first-hand experience on
encryption algorithms, encryption modes, paddings, and initial vector (IV). Moreover, we will be able
to use tools and write programs to encrypt/decrypt messages. This lab covers the following topics:</br>
• Secret-key encryption</br>
• Substitution cipher and frequency analysis</br>
• Encryption modes, IV, and paddings</br>
• Common mistakes in using encryption algorithms</br>
• Programming using the crypto library

- Detailed report of the lab can be found [here]().
