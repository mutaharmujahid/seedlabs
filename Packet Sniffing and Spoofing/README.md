# Packet Sniffing and Spoofing Lab
- The objective of this lab is two-fold: learning to use the tools and understanding the technologies underlying these tools. For the second object, students will write simple sniffer and spoofing programs, and gain
an in-depth understanding of the technical aspects of these programs. This lab covers the following topics:</br>
• How the sniffing and spoofing work</br>
• Packet sniffing using the pcap library and Scapy</br>
• Packet spoofing using raw socket and Scapy</br>
• Manipulating packets using Scapy

- Detailed report of the lab can be found [here](https://github.com/mutaharmujahid/seedlabs/blob/main/Packet%20Sniffing%20and%20Spoofing/Packet%20Sniffing%20and%20Spoofing%20Lab.pdf).


- Edit 1: The files that I uploaded are only for the tasks that require C coding. I had some issues with the old VM and due to some misconfig, all the .py files were corrupted and removed. Maybe I was an attacker's target :)
- Edit 2: The files a.c and b.c I believe are test files. Please check before you execute any file.
