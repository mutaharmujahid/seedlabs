# Packet Sniffing and Spoofing Lab
- The objective of this lab is two-fold: learning to use the tools and understanding the technologies underlying these tools. For the second object, students will write simple sniffer and spoofing programs, and gain
an in-depth understanding of the technical aspects of these programs. This lab covers the following topics:</br>
• How the sniffing and spoofing work</br>
• Packet sniffing using the pcap library and Scapy</br>
• Packet spoofing using raw socket and Scapy</br>
• Manipulating packets using Scapy

- Detailed report of the lab can be found [here]().
