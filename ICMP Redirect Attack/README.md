# ICMP Redirect Attack Lab
- The objective of this task is to launch an ICMP redirect attack on the victim, such that when the victim
sends packets to 192.168.60.5, it will use the malicious router container (10.9.0.111) as its router.
Since the malicious router is controlled by the attacker, the attacker can intercept the packets, make changes,
and then send the modified packets out. This is a form of the Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack. This lab
covers the following topics:</br>
• The IP and ICMP protocols</br>
• ICMP redirect attack</br>
• Routing

- Detailed report of the lab can be found [here]().
