# Web SQL Injection Attack Lab

- In this lab, we have created a web application that is vulnerable to the SQL injection attack. Our web
application includes the common mistakes made by many web developers. Our goal is to find ways to
exploit the SQL injection vulnerabilities, demonstrate the damage that can be achieved by the attack, and
master the techniques that can help defend against such type of attacks. This lab covers the following topics:<br/>
• SQL statements: SELECT and UPDATE statements<br/>
• SQL injection<br/>
• Prepared statement

- Detailed report of the lab can be found [here](https://github.com/MohammedMutahar-Mujahid/seedlabs/blob/main/Web%20SQL%20Injection%20Attack/SQL%20Injection%20Attack%20Lab.pdf).
